    \question{Q.1}{Two metal balls, A and B, are the same size but A is twice as heavy as B ($m_A = 2 m_B$). The two balls are dropped from \textbf{rest} from the roof of a single story building at the same instant of time. The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be:}

         \begin{options}
            \item about half as long for the heavier ball ($\displaystyle t_A = \frac{1}{2} t_B$).
            \item about half as long for the lighter ball ($t_A = 2 t_B$).
            \item about the same for both balls ($t_A = t_B$).
            \item considerably less for the heavier ball ($t_A < t_B$).
            \item considerably less for the lighter ball ($t_B < t_A$).
         \end{options}


    \question{Q.2}{The two metals balls from Q.1 are rolled off of a horizontal table with the same speed. In this situation the horizontal distance ($x$) covered by the balls (from launch to hitting the floor) will be:}

        \begin{options}
            \item about the same for both balls ($x_A = x_B$).
            \item about half as long for the heavier ball ($\displaystyle x_A = \frac{1}{2} x_B$).
            \item about half as long for the lighter ball ($\displaystyle x_B = \frac{1}{2} x_A$).
            \item considerably less for the heavier ball ($x_A < x_B$).
            \item considerably less for the lighter ball ($x_B < x_A$).
        \end{options}
