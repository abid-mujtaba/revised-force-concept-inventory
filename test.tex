    \question{Q.1}{Two metal balls, A and B, are the same size but A is twice as heavy as B ($m_A = 2 m_B$). The two balls are dropped from \textbf{rest} from the roof of a single story building at the same instant of time. The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be:}

         \begin{options}
            \item about half as long for the heavier ball ($\displaystyle t_A = \frac{1}{2} t_B$).
            \item about half as long for the lighter ball ($t_A = 2 t_B$).
            \item about the same for both balls ($t_A = t_B$).
            \item considerably less for the heavier ball ($t_A < t_B$).
            \item considerably less for the lighter ball ($t_B < t_A$).
         \end{options}
