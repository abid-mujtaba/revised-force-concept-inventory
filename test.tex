    \question{Q.1}{Two metal balls, H and L, are the same size but H is twice as heavy as L ($m_H = 2 m_L$). The two balls are dropped from \textbf{rest} from the roof of a single story building at the same instant of time. The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be:}

         \begin{options}
            \item about half as long for the heavier ball ($\displaystyle t_H = \frac{1}{2} t_L$).
            \item about half as long for the lighter ball ($\displaystyle t_L = \frac{1}{2} t_H$).
            \item about the same for both balls ($t_H = t_L$).
            \item considerably less for the heavier ball ($t_H < t_L$).
            \item considerably less for the lighter ball ($t_L < t_H$).
         \end{options}


    \question{Q.2}{The same two metals balls from Q.1 (H and L) are rolled off of a horizontal table with the same speed. In this situation the horizontal distance ($x$) covered by the balls (from launch to hitting the floor) will be:}

        \begin{options}
            \item about the same for both balls ($x_H = x_L$).
            \item about half as long for the heavier ball ($\displaystyle x_H = \frac{1}{2} x_L$).
            \item about half as long for the lighter ball ($\displaystyle x_L = \frac{1}{2} x_H$).
            \item considerably less for the heavier ball ($x_H < x_L$).
            \item considerably less for the lighter ball ($x_L < x_H$).
        \end{options}
