% Define a command for entering questions. It uses a tabularx to format the Q.# part and the actual question
% @{} is used to indicate that horizontal padding is to be zero around the tabularx
% X is used to indicate the the second column should be stretched to fill up horizontal space.

\renewcommand{\marks}[1]{\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}\begin{flushright}$[#1]$\end{flushright}}        % Place the marks below and aligned right

% An 'answer' macro for including the answer in the tex with no output. It can be parsed separately to get the answer sheet.

% Define a custom environment for setting the answers/options for each MCQ.
% We use an indented minipage containing an 'enumerate' environment.
